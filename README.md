# Audeze Maxwell Tool

> ### ⚠️ Please read the instructions carefully before you start
>
> Especially if you are going to make and flash **custom firmware** — the process has some deliberately unintuitive steps, and guessing your way through it will not work. In short: you tune the balance while on firmware **v1.0.1.74**, then **downgrade** to stock **v1.0.1.63**, then **upgrade** to your custom v1.0.1.74, and finally run a **factory reset**. The order matters. Read the [balance walkthrough](#fixing-the-lr-balance--step-by-step) below — or the in-app **Guide** button — all the way through before touching anything.

A self-contained Windows tool for the Audeze Maxwell headset that does two things:

1. **Fixes the L/R audio balance** — permanently, baked into the headset's own firmware, so the fix works everywhere (iPhone, console, PC) with no software running.
2. **Flashes / downgrades firmware** — any version, even though Audeze disabled the official rollback feature.

## How to download — start here

You do **not** need to be technical to use this tool.

**Do not** use the green **`Code`** button or **Download ZIP** at the top of this page — that downloads the source code, not the working app.

To get the tool:

1. Click **Releases** on the right-hand side of this page.
2. Under the latest version, click the **`.zip`** file to download it.
3. **Extract** the downloaded zip — right-click it and choose *Extract All*.
4. Open the extracted folder and double-click **`MaxwellTool.exe`**.

Keep everything in that folder together — the `.exe` needs the other files beside it to run.

**Why this exists.** Firmware v1.0.1.74 left some Maxwell units with an audible left/right loudness imbalance, and there has been no firmware update in roughly two years. This tool lets you measure your headset's balance, dial in a correction by ear, and bake it into a custom firmware that survives reboots and source changes.

### Why the imbalance happens — short version

The L/R imbalance is a bug Audeze added in firmware `v1.0.1.61`. Pre-v61 firmware (the `v1.0.1.56` release we now bundle as an option) doesn't have the bug at all.

**Pre-v61:** the Maxwell firmware had one balance default — `NVDM 0xF668 = 142/142` — symmetric, applied to all audio. No per-source switching, no asymmetric correction. **The imbalance bug literally does not exist in v56.**

**v1.0.1.61 (April 2024)** added a per-source balance system:
* A new asymmetric balance default `NVDM 0xF665 = 141/149` — a per-channel correction for the USB-C audio path.
* The original symmetric default `NVDM 0xF668 = 147/147` stayed in place for wireless.
* A new NVDM byte `0xF702` chooses which one loads at boot: `0x0A` → `0xF665` (USB-C, asymmetric); anything else → `0xF668` (wireless, symmetric).

The headset reads `0xF702` once at boot and uses it to pick the active balance. What's missing is *anything inside the firmware that automatically updates `0xF702` when the audio source changes*. We searched the firmware exhaustively — every function that reads or writes `0xF702`, every dispatch table, every event-bus path, in both the headset and the dongle, across v56/v61/v63/v74 — and could not find an in-firmware auto-switcher. We spent roughly fifty hours on it. It's possible such a path exists in some encoding we missed; we just couldn't find one.

The practical result is that `0xF702` is effectively a frozen value: whatever it was set to at the factory is what your headset is stuck on for life. Factory reset doesn't touch it. The Audeze app doesn't change it. Some units shipped with `0xF702 = 0x0A` (loading the asymmetric `141/149` default) and **those are the units whose owners hear the imbalance**, regardless of how they actually connect. Other units shipped with `0xF702 = 0x00` (loading `147/147` symmetric) and never notice anything wrong. Exactly how production splits this way — per-SKU defaults, per-batch QC variation, a manufacturing step that wrote the byte on some units and not others — we don't know either.

What we *do* know is that Audeze still actively maintains the wireless (symmetric) profile: they rewrote 115 of 118 entries in its DSP coefficient column between v63 and v74, with the v74 patch notes mentioning *"Fixed a bug that would cause EQ issues when updating previous versions of firmware."* They don't touch the USB-C asymmetric column. So the wireless profile is the one Audeze keeps under maintenance and clearly intends users to be on. Whether the USB-C asymmetric profile was ever supposed to be live on shipped units at all is unclear — pre-v56 firmware had no such profile, so users were universally on a single symmetric default.

This tool gives you **three ways to fix it**, in increasing order of "permanence":

1. **One-shot RACE write** — the "Set Audio Source" button on the Balance tab writes `0xF702 = 0`, putting your headset on the wireless profile. The write persists across power cycles (verified empirically — we wrote a probe value of `0x55`, fully power-cycled the headset, and read it back unchanged). No flashing required.
2. **Custom v74 (or v63 / v61) firmware** — bakes your per-unit balance correction into the NVDM defaults *and* patches the `0xF702` reader function to always return `0`. After flashing, the headset ignores `0xF702` entirely and always loads the wireless (symmetric) profile. Functionally this reduces v74 to a **single-path architecture** — the wireless profile is the only one that ever loads, exactly the way v56 worked before Audeze added the per-source machinery.
3. **Custom v56 firmware** — bakes your balance into the pre-bug firmware. No per-source machinery, no asymmetric default, no `0xF702`. **This is rolling back to the firmware from before the bug existed**, with your balance correction applied. Same end result as option 2 architecturally, just achieved by going back rather than patching forward.

The Make Custom Firmware button lets you pick which base version to build on.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11, 64-bit
- The Maxwell headset. A **USB-C cable** is required to flash the headset's firmware; balance read/apply work over the cable *or* the wireless dongle.
- Nothing else — `MaxwellTool.exe` is fully self-contained. No .NET runtime, no Audeze app needed.

Keep the headset charged above ~50% before flashing.

## The window at a glance

When you open **`MaxwellTool.exe`** you get two tabs:

- **Firmware** — flash or downgrade firmware, and factory-reset the headset.
- **Balance** — read, test and bake in an L/R balance correction.

The **top-right corner** shows the firmware version of what is connected — the headset, and (when you are connected through the wireless dongle) the dongle as well. Click **Recheck** to refresh it. The **Guide** button next to the title opens these instructions inside the tool at any time.

## Fixing the L/R balance — step by step

This is the main job of the tool. The result is a custom firmware with your correction built in.

> **Tune your balance on firmware v1.0.1.74.** The L/R imbalance this tool corrects is specific to **v1.0.1.74**, so you must dial in the correction while the headset is *running v1.0.1.74* — tune it on any other version and the values will not be right for the firmware you end up on. The custom firmware you build is itself a v1.0.1.74; installing it is a two-step flash (stock v1.0.1.63 first, then your custom v1.0.1.74 — see step 6). Your current version shows in the top-right corner; if you are not on v1.0.1.74, flash it on the Firmware tab first.

**1. Connect the headset to the PC with the USB-C cable.** Close the Audeze app if it is open. Open `MaxwellTool.exe`.

**2. Go to the Balance tab.** It reads the headset automatically and shows the current Left and Right values. **Read Balance** re-reads any time.

**3. Adjust the Left and Right numbers.**
   - Lower the channel that sounds louder, or raise the one that sounds quieter.
   - Move in small steps (1–3 at a time).
   - **The maximum is 150 by design. Do not try to go higher** — large gain values can overdrive and physically damage a driver.

**4. Click `Apply (live test)`.** The values take effect on the headset immediately. Listen to something with clear centred audio (mono track, vocal) and judge the balance. Repeat steps 3–4 until it sounds centred.

   `Apply` writes the values into the headset and **saves them** — they persist through power-offs and everyday use, on any device (phone, console, PC), because they live in the headset itself. They are only cleared by a **factory reset** or a **fully drained battery**. Step 5 bakes them into the firmware so even a factory reset can't clear them — the permanent form.

**5. When it sounds right, click `Make Custom Firmware`.** The tool bakes your L/R values into a flashable v1.0.1.74 firmware, detects Xbox vs PlayStation automatically, and switches you to the **Firmware tab** with the new file already selected.

**6. Click `Flash Firmware`.** If your headset is already on v1.0.1.74, the tool stops you and tells you to flash stock v1.0.1.63 first (you cannot re-flash the version already installed) — do that, then flash the custom firmware.

**7. Run the factory reset.** After the custom flash the tool checks the headset and — because the baked-in values are not active until a reset — prompts you with a **Run Factory Reset** button. Click it. This step is required: flashing only updates the firmware *code*; the factory-reset routine is what writes the new balance into the headset's settings.

Once done, the fix lives in the headset. It works on a phone, a console, anything — with nothing connected to a PC. The tool checks your connection at every step and will stop you before a common mistake (dongle still plugged in, wrong version, skipped reset) costs you a 10-minute flash.

> **Only the headset needs custom firmware — the wireless dongle does not.** The balance correction is baked into the *headset's* firmware. There is no custom firmware for the dongle, and you never need to flash the dongle to get the balance fix. Leave the dongle on its stock firmware.

## Flashing firmware

The Firmware tab also works as a plain firmware flasher / downgrader.

1. Pick **Target** (Dongle / Headset) and **Version**. The **Platform** (Xbox / PlayStation) is detected from the connected device automatically.
2. Click **Flash Firmware** and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Headset flash — get the headset into the right state first

This is the single biggest factor in whether a headset flash succeeds:

1. **Unplug the wireless dongle** from the PC.
2. **Turn the headset fully off** — no lights on it at all. (If you see *any* light while the USB-C cable is unplugged, it is **not** off.)
3. With the headset off, **wait about 5 seconds**.
4. **Plug the USB-C cable** into the headset.

Close the Audeze app before flashing. In this "connected but off" state the tool's top-right corner shows the headset's firmware version — once you see it, the headset is connected and ready to flash. (That display is the connection check; you don't need to look for the headset in the Audeze app.)

If a flash fails, put the headset back into that state: unplug the USB-C cable, wait 5–10 seconds (headset still off), plug it back in, then retry.

**Dongle flash:** plug the dongle into the PC, power the headset on (wirelessly paired), close the Audeze app.

A flash takes roughly **5–10 minutes**. Do not disconnect anything until it finishes. The tool checks the connection before it starts and will stop you if, for example, the dongle is still plugged in while you are flashing the headset, or you are trying to re-flash the version already installed.

A slow transfer is **normal** — do not panic and do not unplug. Here is a flash that ran past six minutes and finished fine:

![A Maxwell headset flash in progress — the transfer ran to 390 seconds and completed successfully. A long flash is expected; let it finish.](assets/flashing.png)

### The same-version rule

The flasher cannot re-flash the version that is already installed — it needs a version *change*. So:

- To install a **custom v1.0.1.74** onto a headset already on v1.0.1.74:
  **first flash stock v1.0.1.63**, then flash the custom v1.0.1.74.
- The top-right version display tells you which case you are in.

This is why a custom-firmware install is sometimes a two-flash process.

---

## Factory reset

The **Factory Reset** button (on both tabs) restores the headset to factory defaults. It uses the same mechanism as the Audeze app's reset.

Use it:

- **After flashing a custom firmware** — required, so the baked-in balance applies.
- Any time you want to clear the headset's settings (EQ presets, sidetone, etc.).

The headset reboots and re-connects on its own, about 15-20 seconds (the reset restarts the headset twice). If for any reason the button does not reset it, you can also factory-reset from the Audeze app.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Top-right or Read shows nothing | Make sure the headset (or the dongle) is connected and the Audeze app is closed, then click **Recheck** / **Read Balance**. |
| "Could not connect to device" | Headset flash: get the headset into the off-then-cabled state above. Dongle flash: headset must be powered on and paired. Close the Audeze app. |
| Stuck on "Transferring..." | Normal — a flash can take up to ~10 minutes. Be patient, do not unplug. |
| Status `FAIL/TIMEOUT`, or a flash won't start | Unplug the USB-C cable, wait 5–10 seconds with the headset off, plug it back in, and retry — see the headset-flash steps above. |
| Device shows as a generic "USB Device" | Device Manager → right-click the device → Update driver → "Let me pick" → **USB Composite Device**. |

## How it works

The tool talks to the Maxwell's Airoha AB1568 chip over USB HID using the Airoha **RACE** protocol:

- **Balance read / apply** use RACE gain commands — these relay through the dongle, so balance works over the USB-C cable or the wireless dongle.
- **Firmware version** is read off the headset's flash over the cable; over the dongle, the SDK reports both the dongle and the headset behind it.
- **Make Custom Firmware** decompresses a stock v1.0.1.74 image, patches the factory-default balance values, recomputes every SHA-256 integrity hash, and recompresses it into a valid flashable image.
- **Flash** and **Factory Reset** use the bundled `AirohaHidCoreLib.dll` (the same SDK the Audeze app uses).

The Maxwell uses dual-bank firmware: a successful flash writes the inactive bank and the device swaps banks on reboot, so a power loss mid-flash should leave you on the previous firmware rather than bricked. (Not a guarantee.)

## Build from source

Requires the .NET 8 SDK.

```
cd src
dotnet publish MaxwellTool.csproj -c Release -r win-x64
```

The single-file `MaxwellTool.exe` lands in `src/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`. Run it from a folder that also contains the bundled native DLLs (`AirohaHidCoreLib.dll`, `AirohaPeqLibrary.dll`, the `libgcc`/`libstdc++`/`libwinpthread` runtime DLLs) and the `firmware/` folder. The stock firmware images used by *Make Custom Firmware* are embedded in the executable.
